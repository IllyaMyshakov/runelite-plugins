## Plugins/Features
A list of plugins/features I've experimented with

### Skill Calculator entries for Blisterwood logs (05/09/2020) :heavy_check_mark:
[Pull Request](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/12456)

### Player Pet List (01/09/2020) :pencil2:
[Pull Request](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/12434)

### Mahogany Homes (27/08/2020) :x:
Show helpful information for Mahogany Homes construction contracts

Pull request was planned for the plugin, though TheStonedTurtle was able to come up with a [working implementation](https://github.com/TheStonedTurtle/Mahogany-Homes), 
so this will stay in a semi-completed state (though World Overlay is non-functional).
